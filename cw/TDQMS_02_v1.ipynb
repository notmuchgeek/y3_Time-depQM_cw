    "\n",
    "A range of modern lighting and display technologies relies on colour conversion layers (CCLs), which enable the efficient conversion of light from shorter to longer wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The newly developed optical material for CCL has been studied through spectroscopic analysis. The material was a transparent and chemically stable polyvinylcarbazole (PVK) film doped with two fluorescent dyes, BV440 and Atto505. The doping concentration for each dye was kept relatively low, less than 1% by weight. Additionally, both dyes were characterized through absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies conducted under steady-state conditions. No phosphorescence or sample degradation effects were observed during the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectroscopic data are provided to you as ASCII files with space-separation between numbers.  Data set includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separately measured [absorption spectrum of BV440](Abs-BV440) (first column – wavelength (nm), second - optical density (OD))\n",
    "* Separately measured [absorption spectrum of Atto505](Abs-Atto505) (first column - wavelength, second - OD)\n",
    "* Separately measured [fluorescence spectrum of BV440](Fluorescence-BV440) (first column - wavelength, second – photon counts in arb.u.)\n",
    "* Separately measured [fluorescence spectrum of Atto505](Fluorescence-Atto505) (first column - wavelength, second – photon counts in arb.u.)\n",
    "* [Transient absorption spectrum](TA_2D-DATA.mx3) of the studied material (BV440 and Atto505 dopped PVK) after excitation at 370nm (2D matrix; the first column contains pump-probe delay times (ps) and the first row contains probe wavelengths; matrix elements show the change in transmission dT/T at the corresponding time/wavelength)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to analyse the experimental dataset and present a report addressing the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify excited states involved in the photochemistry and spectroscopy of the material. Propose a Jablonski diagram showing key processes happening in the material. When possible, specify the energies of excited states\n",
    "2. Discuss and interpret cross-sections through transient absorption spectrum at (at least) two representative times and two representative wavelengths\n",
    "3. Analyse the dynamics of the excited states and extract the timescale(s) of the dynamics using additional information provided by SVD or global fitting. Relate the identified timescales to the relevant dynamical processes on the Jablonski diagram proposed above.\n",
    "4. Where possible, identify the vibrational modes of BV440 and Atto505 (use multiple approaches if you can). Assign the observed vibrational coherences (if any) to the electronic states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please support your analysis with the figures and references to the relevant theoretical background."
